**Project Overview**

This project is designed to compare two popular association mining techniques: Apriori
algorithm and Brute Force method. Although both algorithms are used to find frequent itemsets
in a dataset, through this project we will see the differences in efficiency and scalability between
the two. Throughout the files, certain functions may overlap in both methods and could be
removed for optimization, but to better explain the difference between Apriori vs Brute I created
separate files. These files include count.py, powerset.py, and association.py.
